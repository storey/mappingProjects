# Mapping Projects
In the fall of my Sophomore year at Princeton, I built versions of this program as part of two assignments I worked on. I have briefly touched the programs up and included the code here.

The *sphereSurface* folder includes code that maps data from the surface of a sphere (like Earth) onto various flat projections.

The *starMap* folder includes code that maps data about the location of stars in the night sky in various projections.
